# Webpack Reactjs Template

## Getting Started

### Setting up NPM

### Installing Project Dependencies

Running the below shell script will install all dependencies and build the initial JavaScript files.

```bash
npm install
```

> Note: This should be run **every time you pull changes** from git. The dependencies may change and there is no automatic process in place to update them.

### Starting a Local Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, a development server can be launched with the following shell script. It will watch for changes to files in the `src/` folder.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Starting a Production Server

```bash
npm run production
```
